# Goals_Todo_list
A todo list containing goals by Daily, Weekly, including an embedded calendar

This was a fun little project. I have put together a to do list to
practice flex box and grids. I used both for two div sections
one section contains two divs, containing 2 lists. Today, and weekly.
There is no way to interact with the interface.
below this is an embedded Google calender. The resize is limited.
below is a "back to top button. 

Everything works in VS Code with a Live Server and proper connections to
the CSS file. 

Thanks!
